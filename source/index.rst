Welcome to the docmentation of ITRA ! ðŸŽˆ
================================

ITRA (Image Text Representation Alignment) is a codebase for flexible and efficient vision language learning.

TODO list
================================
- CILP finetuning methods (MS-COCO as example)
      - Partially freeze the weighs
            - according to weight type (prams name filter)
            - according to layers
      - MIM and FLIP support
      - 'CLIP Itself is a Strong Fine-tuner' re-implementation (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06138, https://discourse.brainpp)
