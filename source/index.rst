Welcome to the documentation of ITRA ! ðŸŽˆ
================================

``ITRA`` (abbreviation for Image Text Representation Alignment) is a codebase for flexible and efficient vision language learning. ``ITRA`` features a unified interface to easily access state-of-the-art pretrained models, adapters, loss functions from various sources.

``ITRA`` supports training, evaluation and benchmarking on a rich variety of tasks, including zero-shot/k-NN/linear classification, retrieval, word embedding and sentence embedding evaluation. In the meantime, ``ITRA`` is also highly modular extensible and configurable, facilitating future development and customization.

.. Important::
   ``ITRA`` is an ongoing project and its codes are still under development. A temporary repository of the codebase is located at: https://github.com/ChenDelong1999/ITRA

.. note::
   If you find any bugs or have any recommendations for building ``ITRA``, please raise a issue in the repo, thanks~
